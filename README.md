# Python-Programming

Assignment 1: This program is designed to perform basic mathematical operations.

Explaination:

In this program, we declare two variables named `a` and `b`, and take integer input from the user using the `input()` function, combined with the `int()` function to convert the input to integers.
We then create four variables: `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div`, which store the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations respectively, using assignment operators.
Finally, we print the results of each operation using the `print()` function.

Output:

Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 10              
Addition: 15
Subtraction: -5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 0.5

Thank you.

Assignment 2: Write a Python program that Create a Personalized Greeting.

Explaination: 

In this program, we declare two variables: `firstName` and `lastName`, and take input from the user using the `input()` function.
Next, we create a variable named `fullName` by combining the first name and last name with a space in between using the `+`operator.
Then, we create another variable called `greeting`, where we form a complete welcome message by joining the string `"Hello,"`, the `fullName`, and the rest of the message using string concatenation.
Finally, we print the greeting message using the `print()` function.

Output: 

Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello,John Doe! Welcome to the Python program

Thank you.
