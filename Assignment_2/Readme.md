Assignment 2: Write a Python program that Create a Personalized Greeting.

Explaination: 

In this program, we declare two variables: `firstName` and `lastName`, and take input from the user using the `input()` function.
Next, we create a variable named `fullName` by combining the first name and last name with a space in between using the `+`operator.
Then, we create another variable called `greeting`, where we form a complete welcome message by joining the string `"Hello,"`, the `fullName`, and the rest of the message using string concatenation.
Finally, we print the greeting message using the `print()` function.

Output: 

Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello,John Doe! Welcome to the Python program


Thank you.
